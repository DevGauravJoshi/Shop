## Introduction

I created an E-commerce website using React js⚛️

Fully responsive ✔️ ( Website will work in Desktop, Tablet and Phone etc.)

React router ✔️ ( Website will not reload every time user switches from one section to another. )

Scroll animation ✔️ ( Animation work only when you start scrolling.) etc.

Special thanks to Netlify for the web hosting service it was so easy to use.😄

Hope you all guys like the website

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for tge client and server side to start the development server
